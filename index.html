      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My place of birth is Chicago, Illinois. I am an entrepreneur and investor. I have successfully traded in the crypto market gaining hundreds of thousands of dollars. I just obtained my real estate license to invest and grow a business.
        In addition, I partnered up with an experienced contractor to obtain a contractor license and open a home remodeling business. Lastly, I learned web programming to supplement all my business. </p>

        <h3>Trading</h3>
        <p>With 3 years of experience, I have successfully lost hundreds of dollars to finally capitalize on hundreds of thousands of dollars.
          The key to success is to not trade with emotions.</p>

        <h3>Real Estate License</h3>
        <p>I am Realtor that works with Century 21 SGR. I have been trained and guided by mentors who have a gross of sales in the millions.
          I am ambitious to grow my database weekly. With my negotiation and market background success is inevitable.</p>

        <h3>Contractor License</h3>
        <p>ACR Remodeling is one of my most recent start ups. I partnered up with a contractor who has devoted his whole life to construction. It was easy to obtain all permits required to work in the city of Chicago and deliver
          quality work and most importantly not expensive.</p>
